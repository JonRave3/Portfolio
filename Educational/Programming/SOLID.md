# SOLID
Five design principles intended to make object-oriented designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable.

**S - Single-Responsibility** Principle: Every class should have only one responsibility.

**O - Open-Closed** Principle: Open for extension, but closed for modification. Classes should be inheritable but not modifiable.

**L - Liskov Substitution** Principle: Functions that use pointers or references to base classes must be able to use objects of derived classes without knowing it (Design By Contract). This means that every subclass or derived class should be substitutable for their base or parent class.

**I - Interface Segregation** Principle: Clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces that they do not use.

**D - Dependency-Inversion** Principle: Depend upon abstractions/Interfaces, not concretions.
